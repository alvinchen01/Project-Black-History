<h2>The Challenge Ruby Bridges Faced</h2>
<p>
In 1960, Ruby Bridges became the first Black child to attend an all white elementary school in New Orleans.
She was only six years old. Many people protested her presence at the school.
She needed federal marshals to walk her into the building for protection.
</p>

<p>
For most of the year she learned alone in a classroom because parents removed their children.
This shows how segregation led to unequal educational opportunities.
